# Purpose

This is a short project focused on applying traditional inferential statistical techniques (specifically the paired t-test) to determine the significance of an effect and its size. The focus is on the psychological effect known as the Stroop Effect. 

# The Data
A group of participants were given colored text where the text was the names of colors (e.g. "red" colored in red font) and they were measured as to how quickly they were able to identify the color (in seconds). This was known as the Congruent test. Then they were given text that described a different color than the actual font color (e.g. "blue" colored in green font) and the same measurement was done. This was called the Incongruent test.

# The Analysis

I compared the means of the two tests using a paired t-test approach and found that the difference between the two groups was indeed statistically significant, indicating that the Incongruent treatment indeed does produce a non-random effect in the participants.
