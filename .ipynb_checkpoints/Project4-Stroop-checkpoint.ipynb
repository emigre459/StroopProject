In addition, I answer questions posed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree project that these data come from. First, let's reproduce the background information provided as part of the project, to establish context."

    "## Background Information\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant’s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example <span style=\"color:red\">RED</span>, <span style=\"color:blue\">BLUE</span>. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example <span style=\"color:brown\">PURPLE</span>, <span style=\"color:green\">ORANGE</span>. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition."

    "1. What is our independent variable? What is our dependent variable?\n",
    "2. What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? What kind of statistical test do you expect to perform? Justify your choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it’s your chance to try out the Stroop task for yourself. Go to [this link](https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/java/ready.html), which has a Java-based applet for performing the Stroop task. Record the times that you received on the task (you do not need to submit your times to the site.) Now, download [this dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9Yf01UaIbUgQXpYb2NhZ29yX1U/view?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1528668949102000) which contains results from a number of participants in the task. Each row of the dataset contains the performance for one participant, with the first number their results on the congruent task and the second number their performance on the incongruent task.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Report some descriptive statistics regarding this dataset. Include at least one measure of central tendency and at least one measure of variability.\n",
    "4. Provide one or two visualizations that show the distribution of the sample data. Write one or two sentences noting what you observe about the plot or plots.\n",
    "5. Now, perform the statistical test and report your results. What is your confidence level and your critical statistic value? Do you reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject it? Come to a conclusion in terms of the experiment task. Did the results match up with your expectations?\n",
    "6. **Optional:** What do you think is responsible for the effects observed? Can you think of an alternative or similar task that would result in a similar effect? Some research about the problem will be helpful for thinking about these two questions!"

    "\n",
    "* **Null hypothesis:** $H_0: \\mu_{time_A} - \\mu_{time_B} = 0$, where $\\mu_{time_A}$ is the mean response time for a population subjected to Condition A, and $\\mu_{time_B}$ is the mean response time for a population subjected to Condition B.\n",
    "    * In other words, it is expected that the average response time for the population, when exposed to Condition A, will be equivalent to the average response time for the population exposed to Condition B. This means that we expect it will be equally fast for a participant to respond to congruent and incongruent color representations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Alternative hypothesis:** $H_A: \\mu_{time_A} - \\mu_{time_B} \\neq 0$\n",
    "    * In English terms, we expect that the mean population response time for Condition A will differ in some way from those for Condition B. Intuitively, it seems likely that Condition B will elicit a longer average time than Condition A, meaning that we could use a directional hypothesis (e.g. $\\mu_{time_A} - \\mu_{time_B} \\leq 0$). However, a more conservative approach that will require a larger effect size to see it (and that ensures we don't lose information in the scenario wherein Condition A's average response time is actually *larger* than Condition B's) is to require simply a lack of equivalency between the two Conditions' outcomes, which is what we're doing with this hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the response times we'll be using in this analysis are paired (each participant is exposed to Condition A and B, with their response time for each recorded), and given the nature of our hypotheses, **we'll be using a two-tailed paired t-test for this analysis. We'll assume significance at the 95% confidence level (and thus $p < 0.05$)**, a pretty common assumption for statisticians. The logic for using a t-test here is the relatively small ($n = 24$) number of responses: a \"large\" $n$ value for human subject experiments is typically considered to be 30 or more. As this is considered a relatively small sample, it would be inappropriate to assume that the distribution of the sample is normal AKA Gaussian in nature: rather, it is expected to follow a t-distribution, hence our utilization here of a t-test."

Additionally, we can see the distribution of the data at different response time levels via the shape of each plot (both of which are scaled to be reflective of their respective counts to provide an accurate categorical comparison). As we can see here, the medians and interquartile ranges are significantly different, being higher for Incongruent than Congruent responses, whetting our palettes for the upcoming statistical testing and suggesting a significant difference between the two conditions."

This description in my words aligns well with the concepts of [\"selective attention\" and \"automaticity.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect#Selective_attention)\n",

My immediate thought of an alternative experiment is to test someone's ability to identify shapes using a shape name paired with a visual representation of the shape. \n",

This is somewhat more an example of priming the human mind, but arguably the Stroop experiment does something similar by providing the Congruent test before the Incongruent one (an ideal experimental design would randomize which participants receive first)."
